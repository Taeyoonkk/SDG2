  <h4><u>As many as 828 million people — about 10% of the global population — regularly go to bed hungry. Economic shocks, extreme weather events, and conflicts like the war in Ukraine have restricted global 
    food supplies, driven up prices, and presented a threat to vulnerable populations and countries.</u></h4>
    <br>
<h4><u>To achieve zero hunger by 2030, urgent coordinated action and policy solutions are imperative to address entrenched inequalities,
    transform food systems, invest in sustainable agricultural practices, and reduce and mitigate the impact of conflict and the 
   pandemic on global nutrition and food security. </u></h4>
